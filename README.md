# Language-Translation

The project aims to build a machine learning model from one sequence to another, using PyTorch and TorchText. This will be done in a German-to-English translation, but models can be used for any problem that involves switching from one sequence to another, such as summarizing, meaning from sequence to short sequence in the same language.
The model will process German sentences in alphabetical order and produce a translated sentence of English sentences per letter.
